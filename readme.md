# CSS Octocats
-------------
In this project, I used CSS in order to style the HTML document to appear the same as a design comp.
I started with this index.html file that I wasn't allowed to modify, and I created an empty styles.css.

# Skills Used
I resized images dynamically and used flexboxes to organize elements.
I used pseudo elements to change some HTML text, and add shapes to containers.
